    <h3>ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Udon noodles</li>
            <li>Scallion</li>
            <li>Stir-fry sauce</li>
            <li>Shitake mushrooms</li>
            <li>Bok choy</li>
            <li>Garlic</li>
        </ul>

    <h3>steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Heat the vegetable oil in a large pan on medium-high heat then add the scallions and garlic and saute for 1 minute. Then add in the shitake mushrooms and bok choy</li>
        <li>Saute the shitake and bok choy for 3-4 minutes. The bok choy will shrink a lot once itâ€™s cooked. Boil the udon noodles for one minute to separate them, drain them, then add the udon noodles to the pan.</li>
        <li>Add the stir-fry sauce to the pan and toss everything together until the noodles are evenly coated. Taste and adjust any seasoning if needed. Garnish with sesame seeds or chopped scallions. Serve immediately. (noodles are always best enjoyed fresh!)</li>
